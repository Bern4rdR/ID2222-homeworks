Document A:I was used to having cramps so badly that they would leave me balled up in bed for at least 2 days.  The Ponstel doesn't take the pain away completely, but takes the edge off so much that normal activities were possible. Definitely a miracle medication!!
Document B:Had generalized anxiety daily prior to treatment, and panic attacks that impaired ability to function normally and quality of life in general. Medication did not completely eliminate feelings of anxiety, but did a great job of reducing them. Taking the medication Serzone, made it possible to rely on the medication xanax less and less, to the point only had to take it seldom as needed.

Document B:I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person.

Document B:My pain and anxiety were considerably lower. I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle.


Document A:The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a "treatment for the symptoms". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life.
Document B:Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.

Document B:My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies.

Document B:I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug.

Document B:I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear.

Document B:Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.

Document B:I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced.

Document B:I had   persistent periodontal problems, both stressful and painful.  Every dentist I saw  told me I was going to lose my teeth.  This drug  cleared up the condition.  It protected me against inflammation for the entire period of time that I took it.  I continued taking the drug much longer than is usually recommended because it was so effective. The effectiveness did not seem to diminish.

Document B:Reduce a lot the heartburn feeling, and after a week treatment no more heartburn where visible. Every other meal i was taken produced a lot of acid juices in my stomach, after that treatment this never happen.

Document B:For many years, every Spring I would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. After a few days, these symptoms went away. It really surprised me because I had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. Some years my symptoms were so bad that I couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because I was sneezing so much. Taking this medicine gave me my life back!


Document A:I think that the Lyrica was starting to help with the pain, but the side-effects were just too severe to continue.
Document B:My  bone density's results have always been stable and I was told to continue with the drug.


Document A:Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage.
Document B:After I built up a tolerance, I had little peeling when I applied it only once a day. Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the Retin-A is a good addition.


Document A:This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.
Document B:I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.


Document A:I found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles.
Document B:There were no benefits, only bad side effects in that the drug significantly worsened my ability to breath.


Document A:I found that this drug helps significantly with my level of depression and monthly irritability that occurs around my menstrual cycles.
Document B:decrease in moodiness, irritability, cessation of depression/dysthymia related symptoms.


Document A:For the first time in my life I had enough lashes to apply mascara to.  I had tried eyelash extensions which only broke off or pulled out what few thin lashes I did have.  Strip lashes were itchy and uncomfortable.  I now have normal lashes.
Even though I only applied it to upper lashes the lower lashes have grown longer and thicker too.

Document B:For the first time in my life, I had enough eyelashes to apply mascara to.

After several months of Latisse I have eyelashes and even though I apply it only to upper lashes it has made lower lashes grow too.

Document A:Aldara did seem to crust up my previous skin cancer area and help minimize my scar from MOHS surgery for skin cancer. Due to the side effects I could only tolerate for one week opposed to 6 week regiman.
Document B:Other Osteoporosis prevention drugs have many side effects.  This particular drug has almost no side effects and has shown evidence in clinical testing to reduce the occurance of breast cancer.  The only side effects I had are leg cramps and apparently, only a very few women experience this condition.

Document A:The treatment benefits included Skin Regeneration, and decreased Acne.  My skin felt more smooth and the pigmentation was disapearing.  Overall, the goals were accomplished however the redness of the skin took over.
Document B:the treatment benefits for the cream Tazorac were improved skin tone, appearance of reduced wrinkles on forehead, undereye area, upper lip and nose. The skin felt softer and pimples were not prominent.


Document A:I had taken Pulmicort, and other inhalants, with no major changes.  It became more difficult to maintain my exercise and lively life style. I gave in and began Symbicort and immediately experienced a relief of shortness of breath, weezing.  I feel like a new person. I still have a reaction to cold wind, and very high humidity, but so much better.  I rarely use my Albuterol.
Document B:The drug has slowed down the process of osteoporosis in my hips.  I feel much better, with less pain than before.  I was very pleased with my checkup when I went to my doctor.  I feel the combination of the Fosamx and the Caltrate Plus

Document A:It seemed to work at first, but then the side effects started. Fatigue, severe memory loss, poor decisions, urinary incontinence, personality changes (crabby, irritable, withdrawn). The hard part is I can't seem to get off this stuff!! The withdrawals are horrible, shakiness, feelings of doom, loss of appetite, nausea, palpitations. It scares me so much that I just start taking it again. I'm stuck!! Don't ever start this stuff, there is something wrong with it. I don't know if I will ever be myself again.
Document B:The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all.

Document B:Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had "bouts" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life.


Document A:I was more alert during the first part of the day but I found that it wore off by the afternoon. I could focus clearly, and if I needed a boost during the day another dose was enough.
Document B:Taking the medicine was only once a day at the time I chose to take it. It helped me most during stressed situations of any size. I could handle anything and not get angry.


Document A:Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.
Document B:I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours.

Document B:Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.

Document B:Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking "opiate"), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any "highs". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a "partial-opiate agonist", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.

Document A:migraine headache would stop
Document B:no a.m. headaches


Document A:The drug was pretty good for pain. They had me on morphine, which was horrible. The pain was preferable to the crazy dreams and paranoia I had. They then tried oxycontin, which was the best pain drug they gave me, but too addictive... so they moved me to vicodin products, which worked pretty well, with surprisingly few side effects.
Document B:Effectively controlled acid reflux.  Before treatment patient had severe acid reflux which was not controlled by other medications.  After trying many other drugs the patient was prescribed protonix and it worked very effectively.  The patient was then able to eat regular meals with no ill effects.

Document A:Eventually Cleared my moderate acne. Had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate, but then accutane completely cleared my skin after 5 months
Document B:I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.


Document A:Brought down my overall cholestorol reading from 218 to 150, LDL from 135 to 90 and triglycerides from 180 to 140 within 3 months time.
Document B:After 60 days on Crestor, 5 mg. per day, in combination with changes to my diet, my LDL (bad) cholesterol fell from 180 mg/dL (high risk) to 95 mg/dL (optimal), a drop of nearly half.  My triglyceride levels were reduced as well.

Document B:My daughter suffered from an outbreak of painful skin boils on her lower back and stomach, probably 6 total over a few weeks.  They would heal individually after draining (also painful) but more would continually form.  The doctor diagnosed them as caused by MRSA and prescribed Septra along with daily washes with hibiclens soap.  It took 5 days for one very large, undrained boil to heal, but it did heal without draining.  More importantly, the boils stopped forming.

Document B:After trying a variety of high blood pressure medicines my doctor prescribed Zestoretic.  Zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of 100/70 from 130/90.  The difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  After experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic I began watching my sodium intake.  I avoid any food that contains 900 or over mgs of sodium per serving.  This pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  After 16 months of watching my sodium intake I have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt

Document A:Very well managed blood pressure within normal, healthy range.  I had an allergic reaction to a more common blood pressure medication, Lisinopril (which is a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).  The newer Tekturna has worked perfectly for me with only the slightest dizziness when I rose too quickly early on, but no side effects at all after the first few weeks.
Document B:The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.


Document A:The drug reduced the frequency of acid reflux events and the associated pain

to work together. With all of them, my blood pressure is within normal guidelines (or very close), but without any one of them, there is an immediate rise
Document B:This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime "hangover" effect and the dose can be increased easily.

Document B:I would get painful swelling in my feet.  I could not even stand the bed sheet to touch my feet.  One time while on vacation I was swollen up to my knees.  The medication makes my life easier.  I don't have to worry that when I wake up I won't be able to walk around my house.  I rarely have any slight indication that the gout is going to be a problem.

Document B:This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime "hangover" effect and the dose can be increased easily.

Document B:My pain and anxiety were considerably lower. I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle.

Document B:Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.

Document B:I was not able to ascertain any benefits from being treated with this medication.  Its purpose was pain relief, and I did not experience any alleviation of my pain.


Document A:Before I started on the drug Lexapro, I felt lethargic and didn't want to get out of bed each morning. I hated getting up and facing the day. I would sit and watch the time pass by. Finally, I went to my Dr. for a checkup and he diagnosed me as being depressed. He put me on Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg. I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times.
Document B:After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours.

Document B:I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours.

Document B:I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.

Document B:The treatment benefits were only temporary.  While it made sneezing and watery eyes diminish, it did not address the issue of respiratory difficulties.  I found that it may have even increased my respiratory symptoms in this process.


Document A:My pain and anxiety were considerably lower. I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks, chest pains, and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle.
Document B:The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all.

Document B:The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.


Document A:I did go to sleep more easily. I'm not sure how effective the time release is, because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep, but upon waking at 3pm, would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep, but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours.
Document B:This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.


Document A:I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers, which only knocked me out, doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life, being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable, which is not me.  I am a very responsible person.

Document B:Little improvement for first week or so but then incredible turnaround. Went from regularly not being able to walk properly due to inflamed sacroiliac joints and general back pain and flu-like aches across whole body most days to a new woman! After 3 months have noticed the last couple of weeks some of the aches and pains starting to come back slightly towards end of the week but overall extremely positive.


Document A:I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.

Document B:The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month.

Document A:I took this medication, Valtrex, upon first experiencing the sensation of tingling and itching symptoms associated with the onset of the beginning of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak on my face which I had experienced many times before - usually once a year.
The next day after taking valtrex as prescribed, redness of the area affected on my face did develop and a blister did appear to be forming, but the affected area had ceased to itch. 
By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters. 
This medication made a real and positive difference for me in the development, disconfort and duration of the symptoms of a cold sore/fever blisters (herpes-simplex) outbreak.
Document B:Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

With that i have only this to say:
Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries.

Document B:I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea

Document B:Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did.

Document B:I saw great symptom reduction in my facial eczema which included itchiness and redness. Previously I was treating my eczema with topical corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and fluticasone. I had been using topical steroids for years and had developed cystic acne. After a few courses of antibiotics for acne treatment I realized using antibiotics was pointless if I continue to use topical steroids. I decided to try an anti-histamine which surprisingly helped greatly. Enough so i could discontinue my hydrocortisone. Using loratadine helped my eczema be tolerable but not "cured". I also managed my eczema with a lot of moisturizing.

Document B:Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.

Document B:Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had "bouts" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life.

Document B:After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours.

Document B:lessening of nerve pain, decrease in depression. Medication will be increased as nessesary. Decrease in parathesis, shaking. Exercise is needed to truly relieve pain. Water based therapy can definetely add to releif from pain. Depression medication helps, relieving the other symptoms, and can increase sleep. In general all treatments, Lyrica, anti-depressants, muscle relaxers and exercise program (including stretching, weight-resistance, aerobic and endurance training and water excerises - this should be followed religiously) combined contribute to relieving pain, depression, control weight gain, and give patient back some resemblance of a normal live.

Document A:Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.
Document B:The benefits are that the medication is very effective in treating menstrual cramping. Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation, I won't experience any cramp at all.

Document B:I took the drug shortly after having my tooth pulled.  I never noticed a great amount of pain, and contribute this to the laughing gas and novicane during the proceduce, and taking the vicadin shortly after the procedure. I took the vicadin drug twice because after several hours I started to feel pain again.  It was effective in reliefing my pain.

Document B:I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking, as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp, and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug.

Document B:Other Osteoporosis prevention drugs have many side effects.  This particular drug has almost no side effects and has shown evidence in clinical testing to reduce the occurance of breast cancer.  The only side effects I had are leg cramps and apparently, only a very few women experience this condition.

Document B:Upon first taking the medication it significantly reduced my hunger almost to the point that I had to remind myself to eat during the day.  It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.

Document B:I started this medicine to help my acne, but after a couple of weeks there was no improvement at all.  In fact, my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.

Document A:While taking this method of birth control, my period only came once every three months. It was much lighter than before and only lasted 3 days instead of 6, which was normal before.

Document B:After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.

Document A:While taking Xyrem, I slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds.

Document A:While taking Xyrem, I slept exceptionally well at night, woke up rested, and strangely, within months of starting the medication, lost fifteen or more pounds.
Document B:I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.


Document A:The medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine. Now the panic attacks are few and far between. Although I do not like to drive while taking the medicine, if I must I can with no problems. In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode.
Document B:Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.


Document A:Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had "bouts" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life.
Document B:I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea

Document B:It greatly helped with my depression which was caused by a divorce after 28 years of marriage. 3 months after my separation my Father died and my Mother became very angry and unresponsive with me.When I started taking this medication I was able to focus better at work and at home I was able to effectively deal with my emotions, I also experienced an increase in my libido. I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion).

Document B:I used to live on my MDI(combivent). I started maintenance drugs Spiriva and Symbicort and it has changed my world. I, on adverage, dont have to take my MDI at all anymore. I have my days that I have to, living in Texas can be a nightmare of allergies. I can do more activities without feeling so short of breath. I have not had any major side effects yet...Overall after starting Spiriva I'm doing much better. For anyone with Asthma I would suggest they try this drug.

Document B:For many years, every Spring I would get very troublesome nasal allergy symptoms--tingling,burning, itching, sneezing, etc. After a few days, these symptoms went away. It really surprised me because I had tried many other medicines that didn't work, that also caused severe drowsiness and dry-mouth. Some years my symptoms were so bad that I couldn't go out to a restaurant or movie because I was sneezing so much. Taking this medicine gave me my life back!

Document A:The patient saw effective acne control within 4 weeks.  She still had occasional acne lesions but saw clearing of most of the comedones.  Because there were few new acne lesions, the hyperpigmentation she got along with the acne was not happening, and the hydroquinone helped to clear the hyperpigmentation she already had.  At four weeks, her skin tone was even.
Document B:marked reduction in hyperpigmented (age) spots, marked reduction in wrinkles around mouth and eyes, skin surface became much smoother and softer.  Truly turned back time.  Visible results within weeks and first 2 months were remarkable, but over the last year, the benefits have continued and areas of brown discoloration I thought would need laser therapy are almost cleared up!  I also had some scar dents that have cleared up and/or mostly gone!

Document B:Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.

Document B:The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.

Document B:The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.

Document B:Greatly benefitted depression. I started to take this just before my child was born, having had post partum depression with another baby, and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic, if not more hectic, when this child was born as when the older child was born.

I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born.

Document B:I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea

Document A:The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it.

Document B:Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

With that i have only this to say:
Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries.


Document A:I started out with 100 mg twice a day and after about 3 years I've had to increase dosage to 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg at bedtime. It seems to keep my arthritis fairly under control but I have never been able to just take it once a day but I've also had arthritus for 35+ years. Unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. This mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what I want to do.
Document B:The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.

Document B:After I built up a tolerance, I had little peeling when I applied it only once a day. Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical, used occasionally), I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor, the Retin-A is a good addition.

Document B:Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did.

Document A:I used to live on my MDI(combivent). I started maintenance drugs Spiriva and Symbicort and it has changed my world. I, on adverage, dont have to take my MDI at all anymore.

Document B:Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.

Document A:I saw great symptom reduction in my facial eczema which included itchiness and redness. Previously I was treating my eczema with topical corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and fluticasone. I had been using topical steroids for years and had developed cystic acne. After a few courses of antibiotics for acne treatment I realized using antibiotics was pointless if I continue to use topical steroids. I decided to try an anti-histamine which surprisingly helped greatly. Enough so i could discontinue my hydrocortisone. Using loratadine helped my eczema be tolerable but not "cured". I also managed my eczema with a lot of moisturizing.
Document B:I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear.


Document A:My Dr. prescribed Cymbalta to treat my chronic tension headaches. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year, but gained about 30 pounds. Due to the excessive weight gain I gradually went off the Lexapro. Well- about 5 weeks later my headaches came back. My Dr. reccomended Cymbalta b/c it "weight neutral" and also has pain relieving properties.
Document B:I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.

Document B:My legs used to jump pretty badly and so did my arms every night about 60 times per hour, that's once a minute.  Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies.

I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion).


Document A:Effects on the infection were immediate; felt better in the 
first week of treatment.
Document B:The benefits of the treatment were clearing a fungal infection that plaqued me for a few months.


Document A:After about two weeks of being on the medicine, I started to feel a little better but I think it takes awhile for it to really kick in. The medicine has helped me by the following:
Lessened depression, better overall mood, slightly less irritable and sensitive, better able to function daily
Document B:'Was diagnosed with H1N1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course.

Document B:I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.

Document B:The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more.

Document B:After applying the medicament, the itching sensation reduced after 20 minutes and irritation slowly dissapeared after 10 days, The irritation  occasionally re-occurred. I have applied the medicament occasionally (about twice a month) when the irritation re-occured for about oone years. Now the irritation never reappears


Document A:Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you, though it is not a cure all by any means.
Document B:Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking "opiate"), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any "highs". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a "partial-opiate agonist", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.

Document B:BENRFITS OF TREATMENT: Unsure - My legs ache. I don't remember ever having any real pain, other than an annoying ache in both legs. I feel as though I am walking in wet fishing boots.  There is a buzzing in my legs and feet. It has over the past several years crept up from my ankles to above my knees. With all this I do very well walking a slow pace - sometimes like a drunken Sailor. I walk down 101 stairs  tale a short walk and come back up 2 at a time (slowly) holding onto a rail (now).

Document B:Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.


Document A:I was prescribed Keflex to take as a precaution to prevent infection prior to a scheduled surgery.  I took if for several days before and after the surgery.
Document B:Had to take an extra 1/2 pill in addition to prescribed dose of 1/2 pill per event, usually night before in order to achieve satisfactory benefit of performance.  Previously used another brand but was discontinued by HMO.  Much depends on regular exercise & regular sleep activities to be effective.

Document B:After having tried several over the counter treatments for this condition, this treatment was the only one that effectively treated the condition.  The itching and discoloration began to dissipate after a few days and symptoms were completely gone after two weeks.


Document A:I have tried many other medications that were useless.  Over the counter as well as other px.  This treatment always works.  The headache subsides in one to two hours.

Document A:When I first began taking the pill my periods were regulated and I did not cramp nearly as much.

Document A:restful sleep
Document B:I am able to get good restful sleep and that is so important in my pain management.


Document A:I would get painful swelling in my feet.  I could not even stand the bed sheet to touch my feet.  One time while on vacation I was swollen up to my knees.  The medication makes my life easier.  I don't have to worry that when I wake up I won't be able to walk around my house.  I rarely have any slight indication that the gout is going to be a problem.
Document B:This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness.

Document A:This drug definitely helped control flares and joint stiffness. It also helped defeat the incredible amount of hives. Hives were completely controlled.
Document B:This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime "hangover" effect and the dose can be increased easily.

Document A:Greatly benefitted depression. I started to take this just before my child was born, having had post partum depression with another baby, and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic, if not more hectic, when this child was born as when the older child was born. I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline, which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born.
Document B:I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.

Document B:The symptoms and mal feelings of my prostate disapeared - but not completely (perhaps 70% of the Problems disapeared).
Sexual Funktion and feelings of prostate improved remarkable.

(Only 70% of improvement perhaps my personal problems were not solved with Ibuprofen - and such problem put a lot of stress on prostata in some men)

Document A:I saw almost no benefits to this treatment with re: acne, though possibly there was exfoliation or collagen benefit. I believe it exacerbated my acne. On the mornings after the nights I used the cream, my acne seemed to come out much worse (particularly on the chin & jaw area where the condition was the worst).
Document B:The treatment benefits was estrogen replacement.  This estrogen patch system significatly reduced my headaches.  Estrogen is not processed through the liver when delivered via a patch, therefore reducing hormone induced migrains.  I felt normal for the first time in years after my hysterectomy.  I love this medication.


Document A:My obsessive thoughts completely disappeared. This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.
Document B:Was often so tired that I barely got through my work day and would go home and sleep.  My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.


Document A:The only benefit I received from this drug was the ability to get through my day without experiencing unbearable pain. My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month.
Document B:I did not experience any benefits whatsoever.


Document A:I've been on yasmin four years now, it works so great! I have no side effects, just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  But my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time I've been on it! Would definently recommend to anybody.

Document A:Personally, i found metronidazole to be an equivalent to a concentration drug, it severely improved my intelligence and my overall concentration, i realise now that this drug, as it may be depressing, a new chapter in my life.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

With that i have only this to say:
Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries.
Document B:The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.


Document A:Cured the tonsilitis/strep throat
Document B:cured the UTI


Document A:The drug did seem to make me feel more confident at the beginning, however towards the 10 11 months it didn't seem to work anymore.
Document B:There was very little benefit to me. I was having psychotic episodes every day. The drug puportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. The best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.


Document A:Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Document B:I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours.


Document A:I could not see any benefits. I certainly did not feel any more emotionally balanced or stable than before.
Document B:No apparent benefits.  Had virtually no effect on my depression and it quickly became intolerable to use.


Document A:This treatment was easy to remember to take at only one time daily.  Although I didn't miss any dose times, if I had, the directions state to take the missed dose, unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.
Document B:none...I am reguired to write fifty words bon the treatment benefits but since I had to discontinue the drug or die there were no benefits and I would be telling a bald faced lie if I said there were and but I will keep on typing so that I comply with the request for the fifty word minimun

Document B:Taking the medicine was only once a day at the time I chose to take it. It helped me most during stressed situations of any size. I could handle anything and not get angry.


Document A:My symptoms of depression were eased considerably.  I felt more like myself and began to take pleasure in activities. I stopped feeling sad and crying. I was able to concentrate again.  My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.
Document B:Significantly decreased depression and suicidality, improved sleep, more stable moods and increased energy.


Document A:The Darvocet helped with the pain very well in the beginning after returning home from the hospital, but within a week and a half I began to feel as if it weren't helping as much and I needed more. After my two weeks were up on taking it, I gradually just didn't need it any more.
Document B:'Was diagnosed with H1N1 and was ill for at little past 3 weeks.  My doctor gave me a prescription for Tamiflu (2 x day for 5 days) on the 3rd day after becoming rapidly ill (onset of high fever -- temp went from 102.8 to 103.2 pretty fast).  Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course.


Document A:I very mildly scratched my left ankle (right on the protruding bone) while snorkeling in the ocean. 
The abrasion was so small that I didn't do any first aid other than wash the area off when showering.
Over the next 3 days the are became inflamed and I began to apply antibiotic powder to try to dry the inflamed area.
On the 4th morning the tiny scratch had developed to the point were the abrasion was an oozing sore about the size of a quarter and my foot was red and swollen making it impossible to put on a shoe.
I immediately went to a local doctor who prescribed amoxilin tablets.
The drug was very effective and the effects could be felt within 24 hours.
Document B:Ibuprofen generally took away the pain especially when taken early in the onset of the severe headaches.  At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work, generally nothing did.

Document B:The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.

Document B:when the drug actually kicked in, after about 10 days as i recall, it was an amazing experience.I got out of bed and was walking to the bathroom to shower. I was whistling!!!I stopped and thought, hey whats going on here. I realized I felt great, like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time. Never forget it, a fantastic feeling.Truly helped me to cope with the stress of business and relationships.I have recommended it two occasions both had a similar experience to my own.

Document B:This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness.

Document B:less red spots, helped remove red spots...which were usually worse after hot shower, but I enjoy that so I use the metrogel after that when symptoms are worse and it seems to help. I enjoy  coffee, wine, hot spices, hot showers, really only limit sun exposure and the rosecea seems better. Also in the morning if I notice red spots it seems to help.

Document B:There was very little benefit to me. I was having psychotic episodes every day. The drug puportedly taken to stop the episodes did nothing. The best thing it did was make me drowsy and help me sleep.


Document A:Significantly decreased depression and suicidality, improved sleep, more stable moods and increased energy.
Document B:Lessening of suicidal ideation and an increased ability to complete daily life tasks.


Document A:lessening of nerve pain, decrease in depression. Medication will be increased as nessesary. Decrease in parathesis, shaking. Exercise is needed to truly relieve pain. Water based therapy can definetely add to releif from pain. Depression medication helps, relieving the other symptoms, and can increase sleep. In general all treatments, Lyrica, anti-depressants, muscle relaxers and exercise program (including stretching, weight-resistance, aerobic and endurance training and water excerises - this should be followed religiously) combined contribute to relieving pain, depression, control weight gain, and give patient back some resemblance of a normal live.
Document B:I have clinical depression with aggitation and anger. This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg, then shortly increased to 20mg, which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.

Document A:After having this virus for many years I resolved that I was going to look for a possible suppressant. As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.
 
Since taking the drug once daily I have had one only one potential outbreak in the past two and a half  years- at the onset of the potential outbreak I increased the dose to 3  tablets a day twice a day day for four days. This treatment suppressed the outbreak and the symptoms which I felt appeared very slightly and then disappeared within 48 hours.
Document B:Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking "opiate"), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any "highs". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a "partial-opiate agonist", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.

Document B:I fractured of my ankle 30 years ago and about 3 years ago I developed arthritis in the same joint (but nowhere else) which was very painful and caused swelling, redness and reduced movement.  I tried all sorts of treatment (aspirin, ibuprofen and a number of recommended natural remedies, the best of which can be said they made things no worse).  I was prescribed naproxen and this has worked really well, so much so that I have thought on a couple of occasions that I have been 'cured', but within a few days of stopping the tablets twinges reappear.

Document B:the xanax has a calming effect, and takes the edge off the effexor side effects.


Document A:In comparison with other antidepression medications I have taken prior to the effexor, It actually began working faster than the others (after about 2 weeks).  Most antidepressants usually take closer to 4 weeks to see improvements. Depression symptoms were significantly reduced.

Document B:After applying the medicament, the itching sensation reduced after 20 minutes and irritation slowly dissapeared after 10 days, The irritation  occasionally re-occurred. I have applied the medicament occasionally (about twice a month) when the irritation re-occured for about oone years. Now the irritation never reappears


Document A:I had the Accutane treatment in 1997 and the short term results (6 months - 1 years) were fantastic, with the exception that the treatment left a big scar on my face and there is nothing I can do about it. After a year I began to have acne breakouts again. Now, six years later, I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck, chest, behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly. When I when back for another opinion, they wanted me to have a second Accutane treatment -- no way! Also, after the treatment I can't live without chapstick... My lips are always very dry. Hope this helps somebody out there! Bea
Document B:I originally began this treatment for acne and I'm still in the process of my acne treatments. However, after a little over two weeks of treatment and seeing an improvement in my skin, I went in for a pap smear and found out that I have asymptomatic chlamydia. I was prescribed 1 gram of Azithromycin and while doing my research found out that the exact same dosage I've been taking of doxycycline for 1-2 weeks is considered an effective way of treating chlamydia, but clearly that did not work for me.

I felt better than i had felt for a hell of a long time.

Document A:Restasis dramatically improved issues related to dry eyes, the primary problems were discomfort (the feeling that something was in my eye) and obvious redness.  Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.  There was a short period where I ran out of restasis and stopped, after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared, only to do away when I resumed treatment.

Document A:Before I started on the drug Lexapro, I felt lethargic and didn't want to get out of bed each morning. I hated getting up and facing the day. I would sit and watch the time pass by. Finally, I went to my Dr. for a checkup and he diagnosed me as being depressed. He put me on Wellbutrin and Lexapro 10 mg. I was instructed to take the pill 2 times per day everyday. For the first week I felt disconnected from myself but by the 2nd week I started to feel as if each morning was something to look forward to. I believe that Lexapro was a great addition to my life during my troubled times.

Document A:The medicine keeps me calm under all circumstances, and helps me to sleep at night. I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine.

In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode.

Document A:Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.

Document A:The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.

Take it, it aids the physical problems you have, and if your like me at all, with greater ambitions than any human can dream,  This will make you realise all the problems you encounter, and it will cleanse you of your worries.

Document A:This medication saved my life. The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety, panic, or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety, panic, and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression. Try not to take Celexa for cost reasons, Lexapro shows much more promise in its effectiveness.

Document A:The benefits of Celexa have been surprising and welcome.  Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all, some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.

Document A:Before Lexapro I was so depressed I could not function. I forced myself to work, and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had "bouts" of depression before, but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable, unsociable, had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months), cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago, almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work, I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life.

Document A:I would get painful swelling in my feet.  I could not even stand the bed sheet to touch my feet.  One time while on vacation I was swollen up to my knees.  The medication makes my life easier.  I don't have to worry that when I wake up I won't be able to walk around my house.  I rarely have any slight indication that the gout is going to be a problem.
